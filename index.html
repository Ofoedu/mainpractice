<h1>RE: Connect with Intimacy</h1>
<h2>Do you feel stuck</h2>
<h3> Welcome to a space where you get respect and time for you as a sexual being.
    We all experience, in different periods of time in life, the need for support.
    Lets re:frame your experiences.</h3>
<p>Sexual problems can occur as a symptom of something else. 
    If you suffer from problems with stress, anxiety and depression, your sex drive, how you express your sexuality and 
    also your relationship may be affected. It can also be the other way around;
     that your sexual problems (eg past traumas, fears that make it "lock up", 
     \strong feelings of shame that make you not want to approach sexual interaction),
      can affect your mood and your relationships.</p>
